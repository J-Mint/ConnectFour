# ConnectFour
A Java GUI game of Connect Four. 

I really enjoyed making this program. I encountered a few issues along the way which made it a lot more interesting. 


## Issues overcame
- Delay resulting in a player getting 2 turns
- For loop not set up correctly causing program to freeze 

## What I like about it
- Implemented the improvement from my previous project (adding the option to play again).

## Hardest part?
Adding all the winning combinations.
